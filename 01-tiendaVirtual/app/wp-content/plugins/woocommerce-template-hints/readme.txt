WooCommerce Template Hints adds a visual border around parts of all WooCommerce pages showing details about the template used.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Template Hints adds a visual border around parts of all WooCommerce pages showing details about the template used.

If the plugin is active then a frame will be inserted around each template that is used by WooCommerce showing the
file name. Default WooCommerce templates are red and overridden templates are blue.

Hovering over the template name gives the full path of the template being used.

The frames will only be visible to users with 'edit_posts' access.

This is very helpful when developing a new theme for WooCommerce, or troubleshooting an existing theme!

The code is maintained on <a href="https://github.com/growdev/woocommerce-template-hints">Github</a>
