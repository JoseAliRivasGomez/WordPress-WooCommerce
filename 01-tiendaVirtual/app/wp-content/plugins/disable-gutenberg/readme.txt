Disable Gutenberg Block Editor and restore the Classic Editor and original Edit Post screen (TinyMCE, meta boxes, etc.).



== Description ==

This plugin disables the new Gutenberg Editor (aka Block Editor) and replaces it with the Classic Editor. You can disable Gutenberg completely, or selectively disable for posts, pages, roles, post types, and theme templates. Plus you can hide the Gutenberg nag, menu item, and more!

> The all-in-one, COMPLETE solution for handling Gutenberg.
> Hide ALL traces of Gutenberg and replace with Classic Editor.
> Restores original Edit Post screen (TinyMCE, meta boxes, etc.).

The Disable Gutenberg plugin restores the classic (original) WordPress editor and the "Edit Post" screen. So you can continue using plugins and theme functions that extend the Classic Editor. Supports awesome features like Meta Boxes, Quicktags, Custom Fields, and everything else the Classic Editor can do.

> Does not "expire" in 2022! :)


**Easy to Use**

Just activate and done! The default plugin settings are configured to hide all traces of the Gutenberg Block Editor, and fully restore the original Classic Editor. Further options for customizing when/where Gutenberg is enabled are available in the plugin settings.

> NEW! Disable Block Widgets and restore Classic Widgets :)


**Options**

* Disable Gutenberg completely (all post types)
* Disable Gutenberg for any post type
* Disable Gutenberg for any user role

_Super light & fast plugin, super easy on server resources!_


**Why?**

Gutenberg is a useful editor but sometimes you want to disable it for specific posts, pages, user roles, post types, and/or theme templates. This plugin enables you to disable Gutenberg and replace it with the Classic Editor wherever you want. For example, lots of WordPress users already enjoy robust page-building functionality via one of the many great plugins like Composer or Elementor. So many options, no need to feel "locked in" to using Gutenberg!

[More info on installing WP plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins)


**Settings**

Out of the box, Disable Gutenberg makes your WordPress 100% Gutenberg-free. If you visit the settings page, you will see that the "Complete Disable" option is enabled, and so is the "Disable Nag" option. This is all that is required to disable Gutenberg (and the nag) sitewide.

Now, if you want to customize things and, say, only disable Gutenberg on specific post types, you can uncheck that first "Complete Disable" option. When you uncheck the box, more options will be displayed. So you can choose exactly where Gutenberg should be disabled.


**Whitelist**

In some cases, you may want to disable Gutenberg everywhere, but enable only on certain posts. To do this, set the "Complete Disable" option to __enabled__. Then visit the "Whitelist" settings to specify which posts always should open in the Block Editor.


**Important**

Do not use Disable Gutenberg with other plugins (like the Classic Editor plugin) that also disable or replace Gutenberg. Why? Because it may cause loading of redundant scripts, which may in turn lead to unexpected/untested results.


**Hide Menu Option**

Disable Gutenberg provides a setting to disable the plugin's menu item. This is useful if you don't want your clients to get curious and start fiddling around.

If you enable the option to hide the plugin's menu item, you will need to access the plugin settings page directly. It is located at:

`/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=disable-gutenberg`

So if WordPress is installed at this URL:

`https://example.com/`

..then you would access the plugin settings at:

`https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=disable-gutenberg`

Or, if WordPress is installed in a subdirectory, for example:

`https://example.com/wordpress/`

..then you would access the plugin settings at:

`https://example.com/wordpress/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=disable-gutenberg`

So if you hide the plugin's menu item, you always can access the settings directly.


**More Tools**

The settings include a "More Tools" link. Clicking it toggles open some advanced options:

* Classic Widgets - Restores Classic Widgets
* Disable Nag - Disables "Try Gutenberg" nag
* Enable Frontend - Enables frontend block stylesheet
* Whitelist Options - Displays the whitelist settings
* Plugin Menu Item - Hides the Disable Gutenberg menu item
* Gutenberg Menu Item - Hides the Gutenberg plugin menu item (for WP less than 5.0)
* Display Edit Links - Displays "Add New (Classic)" menu links and Classic/Block edit links
* ACF Support - Enables the Custom Fields Meta Box (ACF plugin disables by default)
* Reset Options - Restores the default plugin options

**Uninstalling**

== Upgrade Notice ==

To upgrade this plugin, remove the old version and replace with the new version. Or just click "Update" from the Plugins screen and let WordPress do it for you automatically.

Note: uninstalling the plugin from the WP Plugins screen results in the removal of all settings and data from the WP database. 



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Will this work without Gutenberg?**

Yes. When Gutenberg is active, the plugin disables it (depending on your selected options) and replaces with the Classic Editor. Otherwise, if Gutenberg is not active, the plugin does nothing. So it's totally fine to install before Gutenberg is added to WP core, so it will be ready when the time comes.


**What's the difference between Classic Editor plugin?**

Classic Editor plugin enables you to disable Gutenberg across the board, and replace it with the Classic Editor. The Disable Gutenberg plugin does the exact same thing, in the exact same way, BUT it also provides more granular control over when and where Gutenberg is replaced with the Classic Editor. Disable Gutenberg plugin makes it easy to replace Gutenberg everywhere, OR you can choose to replace only for specific post types, user roles, post IDs, theme template, and more. Check out the list of features and compare them to the alternatives. It's not even close! ;)

Bottom line: both Disable Gutenberg and Classic Editor plugins are lightweight and enable you to replace Gutenberg with the Classic Editor for the entire site. The difference is that Disable Gutenberg also gives you advanced configuration options including menu hiding and more.


**Can I activate Disable Gutenberg without Gutenberg?**

Yes, you can install and activate Disable Gutenberg on any supported WordPress version (see Docs/readme.txt for details). If installed on WP versions less than 5.0 without the Gutenberg plugin active, the Disable Gutenberg plugin simply won't do anything (but you can still configure settings, etc.).


**Can I use this plugin and Classic Editor at the same time?**

Yes, if both plugins are active at the same time, Disable Gutenberg gives priority to Classic Editor plugin. So if you want to use Disable Gutenberg, deactivate the Classic Editor plugin (you do not have to remove it, just deactivate via the Plugins screen).


**Classic Editor planned to expire in 2022, what about Disable Gutenberg?**

I can't make any promises, but I intend to develop with WordPress for the long-haul. Who knows what the future holds, but the plan is to keep Disable Gutenberg going for many years to come. Why? Because the original RTE/Visual Editor is awesome. I strongly feel it's one of the many reasons why WordPress has enjoyed its great success. I've been using the original/classic editor for over 10 years now and it's always been 100% smooth experience. I've tried Gutenberg, and yes it is much better now than in previous versions, but for me it's just not as comfortable or streamlined as the classic editor. So yeah, will do everything possible to keep Disable Gutenberg (and the Classic Editor) going well beyond 2022.


**Why does Classic Editor plugin have way more users?**

Because it is being promoted by the Gutenberg developers and the "official" plugin for replacing Gutenberg. That's fine, but understand that Disable Gutenberg functions the same way AND provides way more features and settings. FWIW, I use Disable Gutenberg on my own sites Perishable Press, DigWP.com, Plugin Planet, and many others. 100% solid.


**Template exclusions not working?**

In order for template exclusions to work, the template must be registered with the page itself. The only way to do this is via the "Edit Page" screen, in the "Page Attributes" meta box. There you will find an option to set the page template. Remember to save your changes.

After assigning some templates, they will be recognized by Disable Gutenberg. So to disable Gutenberg on any registered template, you can add them via the plugin setting, "Disable for Templates". Examples:

* Template name is `page-custom.php`, located in the root theme directory: enter `page-custom.php` in the Template Exclusion setting
* Template name is `page-custom.php`, located in a subdirectory named `templates`: enter `templates/page-custom.php`


**The shortcut links are mixed up?**

In previous versions the default was to show the Gutenberg Editor links. In 1.5.2, the default is to hide the extra editor links. So what I'm guessing happened in this case is that you had a previous version of DG and changed some settings. When you did that, it set the "show edit links" option to the then default, which is enabled. So now that you have upgraded, that saved "enabled" option still applies. Now to fix, you can do one of two things:

- Visit the More Tools and disable the option to "Display Edit Links"
- Or simply click to Restore the default plugin settings

Either route will get you there.


**How to disable default Gutenberg frontend styles?**

The default Gutenberg/Block styles are disabled by default when DG plugin is active. To enable/disable the styles, visit the plugin setting, "Enable Frontend".


**Does this work with full site editing and block themes?**

No, because block themes rely on blocks. [See Block themes article](https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-themes/) for more information.
